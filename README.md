# HOTEL_BAR_SECTION_ANNUAL_SALES

In this analysis, I only make use of two tools EXCEL & POWER BI to solve some business peroblems and provide solutions to the problems after my analysis and visualisation.

I used my DAX function to get TOTAL ITEMS SOLD, SUM OF QUANTITY, COUNT OF CATEGORY, COUNT OF NAMES.

I used matrix chart to get the business level between DAYS, TOTAL ORDER AND PEAK HOUR. This means the time with the highest and lowest order and the day the order was made.

I used donut chart to find the category with the highest and lowest item sold.

I Used clustered column chart get the month with the highest and lowest total item sold.

I Used clustered column chart to know the time with the highest and lowest total order.
